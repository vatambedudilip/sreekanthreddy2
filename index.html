Early life
Mahesh was born on 9 August 1975 in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.[9] He was the fourth of the five children of Telugu actor Krishna and Indira, succeeding Ghattamaneni Ramesh Babu, Padmavathi and Manjula Swaroop and preceding Priyadarshini. Mahesh's childhood was spent mostly in Chennai under the care of his maternal grandmother Durgamma and the rest of his family.[10] Since Krishna was busy with his film commitments, Ramesh used to look after Mahesh's academic performance.[9] Along with his siblings, Mahesh used to play cricket regularly at the VGP Golden beach in Chennai. To spend time with him, Krishna used to make sure that his films' shoots would be conducted at the VGP Universal Kingdom during the weekends.[9]

Krishna also made sure that none of his children would reveal his name during their schooling to ensure a peaceful environment.[9] He was educated at St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in Chennai where actor Karthi was his schoolmate.[11][12] Mahesh in an interview said that actor Vijay and he have been longtime close friends and studied at the same college before establishing themselves in their respective film industries.[13] Mahesh was an above average student. He obtained a bachelor's degree in commerce from Loyola College in Chennai.[14] After graduating, he met with director L. Satyanand in Vishakhapatnam for further training in acting which went on for three to four months.[14] Being unable to read and write Telugu, he used to memorise the dialogues given by his directors during the dubbing phase of his films.[15]

Early career and breakthrough (1979–2003)
At the age of four, Mahesh visited the sets of the Telugu film Needa (1979) where its director Dasari Narayana Rao shot a few sequences of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother Ramesh. Needa marked his debut as a child actor.[16] During the shoot of Poratam (1983) at Vauhini Studios, after watching Mahesh on the sets director Kodi Ramakrishna suggested to Krishna that he cast Mahesh in the role of the protagonist's brother. Initially terrified, Mahesh agreed to act in the film after being persuaded by the film's crew.[16] He went on to act as a child artist in the films Shankharavam (1987), Bazaar Rowdy (1988), Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989). He played a dual role in the film Koduku Diddina Kapuram (1989). Mahesh then appeared in Bala Chandrudu (1990), and Anna Thammudu (1990). Later, Mahesh continued his college studies.[17]
